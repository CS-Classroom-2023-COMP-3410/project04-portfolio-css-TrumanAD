In this project, I found the design process was fairly straightforward. As we practiced in class, I tinkered with elements and their attributes to give the website an aethetic yet functional appearance.
I thought this assignment was pretty entertaining too. I did hit a few roadblocks. The first and biggest was creating one css file for all the different pages. This meant the format for the headers, lists, etc. were 
uniform throughout all the pages. To me, this was fine, but I did have to change some HTML so I could have some variety in between pages. Secondly, formatting the pictures in such a way that made each page look good was tough.
If I centered the photos, they looked bad in the gallery section. However, if I put them side by side, they looked unappealing in all the other sections. For this, I used chatGPT to walk me through and give me some ideas
to fix the situation. Overall, this was pretty decently time consuming, but I think I got the hang of simple CSS, this engraved it into my mind.
